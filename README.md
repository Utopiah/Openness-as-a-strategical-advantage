# Openness-as-a-strategical-advantage
Presentation for Stereopsia 2020 https://europe.stereopsia.com/en/program/xr-causes

Goal : make the process itself open, as promised in the video ([unlisted](https://video.benetou.fr/videos/watch/9b4928b9-3a0e-4c64-91fd-a7120182dd45) until Stereopsia" XR for causes" takes place) so that others build on top and do something better.

## Overall process
1. on paper (see [my sketches](https://github.com/Utopiah/Openness-as-a-strategical-advantage/issues/2))
    1. decompose your topic in a series of steps
    1. map your steps to a journey
    1. find, adapt or create an environment you believe would best illustrate the journey
    1. transforms the steps to visual metaphors with 3D objects while remaining coherent as possible on a single theme
1. design the space (see [my Spoke scene](https://hubs.mozilla.com/scenes/TKz2mzy))
    1. go back and forth to insure the navigation is smooth
1. record one or more videos of the journey
    1. as video editing will follow, it's paussible to pause, stop, etc as need be
1. bring the footage to your video editing solution (see [my kdenlive project](https://github.com/Utopiah/Openness-as-a-strategical-advantage/blob/main/stereopsia.kdenlive))
    1. add all videos, starting with the longest ones
    1. use multiple tracks to adjust
    1. render, get feedback from family and friends, iterage
1. share process and tooling online
    1. create issues or PR here to improve the process
